                        Immersion fosters growth. Our residential program provides a supportive environment, making it accessible for women who may not be able to afford accommodation or transport on their own, and also enables them to spend rigorous disciplined time towards their end goal. Our Pune campus is home to about 100 students in programming and business courses, with a culture of learning which will fuel motivation for these women as well which otherwise may be difficult to replicate in a new space. Eventually, our alumni will be equipped to bring this transformative experience to different communities.
