Hemlata is an HIV positive woman whose in-laws abandoned her after discovering the disease and is now homeless. Shalu falsely took the blame to protect her boyfriend in a battery allegation case, and spent 3 yrs in Tihar. Whatâ€™s common between all three? They all believe that it is their fault and this is the end of life for them, and these circumstances cannot be changed" },
