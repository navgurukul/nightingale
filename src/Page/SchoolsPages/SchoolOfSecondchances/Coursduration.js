                        The program is entirely self-paced with an average duration of 12 to 18 months. Progression may depend upon the womanâ€™s pre-existing learning levels and grasping capacity. Some women might be able to progress to employment within 6 to 8 months while others may take longer than 18 months too. We will continue to invest in their learning till the time they are skilled enough to earn at least Rs. 20k per month</p>
